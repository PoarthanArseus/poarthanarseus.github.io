      <description>Getting Started This is a tutorial on how to get started playing bridge on a casual level. We recommend that you start by learning to play, then bidding, and finally if you are really up for it scoring. Scoring is complex and the rules for it change between different variants of bridge, so the best way to do scoring is to just use the score sheet.
Materials 4 Players Standard 52 Deck of Playing Cards Paper and Pencil(for scoring) Bridge is a card game played with 4 players divided into 2 teams of 2 called pairs/partners.</description>

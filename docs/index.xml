      <description>Getting Started This is a tutorial on how to get started playing bridge on a casual level. We recommend that you start by learning to play, then bidding, and finally if you are really up for it scoring. Scoring is complex and the rules for it change between different variants of bridge, so the best way to start out with scoring is to use a scoring cheatsheet, like this one from ACBL(American Contract Bridge League): https://web2.</description>

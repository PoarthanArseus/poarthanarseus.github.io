# What is Bridge?

Contract Bridge is the ultimate partnership card game, where 4 players are dealt a deck a 52 deck of cards equally. With only the information about their partners and opponents cards communicated through "bidding" on the trump suit at the start of the game, contract bridge is an ultimate strategic game, requiring cooperation, skill, calculation, and unlimited possibilities. It is one of the few games where the best AI are still worse than the best humans and the game has featured many regular playing celebrities like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and astronaut Greg "Box" Johnson.

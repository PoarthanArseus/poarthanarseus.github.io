Hello and welcome to our Bridge club!

As a member of the club, I have to say that playing Bridge is an absolute blast. It's a game that's fun, challenging, and rewarding, and there's always something new to learn and enjoy.

One of the best things about our club is that we have players of all skill levels, from beginners who are just learning the game to experienced players who have been playing for years. It's a great way to improve your skills and meet new people who share your passion for the game.

As a more experienced player, I've had the opportunity to teach the game to some of our newer members. It's been really rewarding to see them progress and improve, and it's always fun to share my love of the game with others.

Today we were able to get a full table of 4, this is Kishore's first meeting and we taught him how to play and we also all did some more learning on the SAYC bidding system. We were able to get a few deals in and they were a lot of fun. We will be scheduling a tournament over the break. Overall, it was a successful and enjoyable day at the Bridge club, hope everyone has a wonderful Winter Break

Our first community event ever on February 3rd.

In this event we had a wonderful time meeting the seniors at the Avamere at Hillsboro Senior living center and the 2 BreAnna's who helped us run and organize the event.

We had 3 seniors who were excited to learn and play the game of bridge. We had a wonderful time teaching them how to play.

At the first table we had Dave and Arthur vs Denzeil and Denzeil, who both quickly picked up the game of Bridge, and at the end Denzeil won a beautiful hand in 4 spades.

At the other table we had another fun match up and played quite a few rounds of bridge.

Overall, this was a successful event and everybody had a lot of fun and learned a lot.

Chris was sick today, but we still had enough players to make a table of 4 and play for a bit. This week being finals week, a few of the other clubs like Chess club were cancelled so we also had Bhavin and Jerry check in earlier and they learned how to play bridge. Overall a great hour of relaxation before the heap of tests coming up.

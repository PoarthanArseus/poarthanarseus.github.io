*Arthur and Barbra having friendly debate on Bridge rules...*

A new semester starts, with momentum on Westview Bridge Club volunteering activitities. We planned all the volunteering time slots with Laurel Parc Senior Living Center through December. 

A beautiful Sunday afternoon in October, we met more people in our Bridge hours. Barbra brought Lila, her dog, to the Bridge Club. We took turns holding Lila, feed her water and comb through her hair. Lila is 8 years old, very dedicated in being part of the Bridge community. 

We reinfored the bidding skills when opening bid is a strong hand calling 2 clubs will the start. Building Kahoot questions for the Bridge Club and hope to test students on how to count points first.

## IMPORTANT:

Hey Bridge players, just want you to know that we had an absolute blast creating our very own BIDDING BOXES!!! (Pictures will be provided later) This is currently our most efficient way of bidding and playing, allowing new players and old players to excel and practice with others visually! We are nearing the end of 2025. Make sure you stay tuned for our new volunteering schedule for 2026!

## Arthur and Dmitry Crash out

Today we had 3 tables of players from the senior living center and some from Westview High School. Unfortunately, many of our bridge players had to focus on other academics and weren't able to show up for the epic beatdown of the instant 4 spades bid. 

Starting off with Arthur's very first game with Dmitry (who hasn't played in a long while), they eventually get cooked by Marilyn and Bob's strong hand of 27+ points, allowing them to make 6 Hearts from a bid of 3 hearts. Then with the next deal, Bob bids a 4 spades as his opening bid! This indicates that he has at least 8 spade cards and a strong hand! What an absolutely insane turn of events.

What an insane hand from a 4 spades bid! Ending up winning 12 tricks at the very end with Bob having 10 total spades! Absolutely insane hands! 

Dmitry, an amazingly fast learner, somehow manages to make 2NT with a beautiful 15 point hand with Arthur's 13 point hand! Awesome play from Dmitry!

Hope everyone had an amazing weekend! Hope to see you tomorrow for some bridge and donuts!

### Tips for Beginners

- Major Suits:
  - Spades
  - Hearts

- Recommended Points to go to Game:
  - 25-26+ points
  - Usually for contracts: 3NT, 4(Spades), 4(Hearts), 5(Diamonds), 5(Clubs)

- NT hands
  - For NT hands, make sure always to count your "winners." What do we mean by this? Count all of the tricks that you can win with the dummy hand and your hand alone.
  - What if after counting my "winners," I don't have enough tricks to make my contract? Well, that is where your planning starts. Usually, with a 1NT hand, we have at least 17-20 points. Let's say we have 2 Aces and 3 kings. 2 of your kings are in a different suit from your aces. This means that they are "potential winners," which means you can potentially win tricks with them in the later game.
  - **(1)** count winners **(2)** count potential winners **(3)** plan out your game and bait out the higher cards to let your potential winners become "winners." **(4)** Got all of your winners? Cash them in for some tricks and wreck the opposing pair!
  - It's important to note that it is recommended to play your longest and strongest suit first before playing other suits in NT. It is also not recommended to play a lone ace at the very start of the play because you get rid of your only stopper.

- Suit Hands (Suit Contracts: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs)
  - For Suit Hands, you want to have **at least 8 cards** in the suit that you are bidding. This way, you have an easier time getting rid of your opponent's "trump." What is trump? Trump is represented as the winning contract that isn't "no trumpt (NT)." So if the contract was 2 Hearts, the trump will be hearts. The reason you want to get rid of your opponent's trump is that the trump is the highest value card, or in other words, the suit can beat "anything."
  - When starting the play, the very first thing you want to do in order to make your contract is to get rid of your opponent's trump by playing your trump. Here's an example: Let's say my dummy hand has 4 heart cards. My hand has 5 heart cards. The contract we bid was 3(Hearts). Here are the Heart cards that we have together: A, K, Q, J, 10, 7, 4, 3, 2. Because each suit has 13 cards and we have 9 of the heart cards, we play the Ace of hearts to make our opponent's play 2 heart cards total. 13-9 = 4 heart cards; this is how many hearts our opponent has in total. 4 - 2 = 2 heart cards; this is how many hearts they have left after playing the Ace of hearts.
  - **(1)** When bidding, make sure to communicate that you have at least 8 cards in the suit you bid. **(2)** Remember to get rid of your opponent's suit. **(3)** Once your opponents are out of trump, start playing other suits. **(4)** You should have around 1-4 Trump cards saved up for the later game.

There's nothing better on beautiful Thursday winter break than playing Bridge.

Arthur and his partner battle the veterans at the Portland Bridge Club. They obtained a positive score of 56.75% and 3rd place overall in their section, ranking them. Arthur also obtains enough Bridge masterpoints to become the 2nd ranked U19 Oregon Bridge player. Details of their play can be found here: [https://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwor/bw.cgi?pid=display\_rank&event=20231221\_1&club=portland](https://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwor/bw.cgi?pid=display_rank&event=20231221_1&club=portland)

Chris and I also participated in this tournament. There is only 1 hand we feel like we messed up, but apparently we didn't place very well with only 46.83% we get 5th place. Reflecting on this we got to play against more people, because although against the Funbridge bots, our play was pretty good, people expect this and they are much better and much less predictable than bots. Here were our results: [https://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwor/bw.cgi?pid=display\_rank&event=20231221\_1&club=portland](https://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwor/bw.cgi?pid=display_rank&event=20231221_1&club=portland)
